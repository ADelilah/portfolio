                  <p>Native speakers or not - we dance and sing in Russian Sign Language in favor of it's official status in Russia.</p>

                <p><b>Curators:</b> Anastasia Neschastnova and Maxim Tiunov, actors of Cinematograph Moscow Deaf Theater.</p> 
                <p><b>Participants:</b> Except 4 actors, all the participants are non-natives, and most of them (me including) was learning RSL no longer than 4 months.</p>
                <p><b>Music:</b> Medley of Russian songs from 80s-90s that are extremely well-known all around the country. </p>
                <p><b>Where and when:</b> Flashmob was performed at one of the biggest shopping malls in Moscow, twice on December 30, 2012, the day when we expect the final decision about RSL status from Russian government.</p>

                <h2>Situation: an ambiguous step forward</h2>
                <p>RSL indeed got some sort of official status exactly at the day when our flashmob was performed. As expected but still unfortunately, in an amendment to the People with Disabilities Act. This amendment means a lot. It means that now it is illegal to punish kids in special orphanages for speaking RSL. It means we may hope some public services will become available in RSL. May be even RSL-related university programs. But. A "special" official language (instead of just another official language) is a legal basis for "special" schools, "special" services, and so on. Legal basis to treat some people differently than other. It does not solve and may be even amplify the major problem - lack of diversity management in society. Which is painfully easy to experience - take subway and speak any sign language. At least it is legal as opposed to other aspects of diversity in Russia.</p>

                <h2>Message: why do we sing</h2>
                <p>Our flashmob had nothing to do with politics. It would be quite naive to expect any attention from Russian government to such an activity. As with other projects, here we reach out to our townsmen hoping that artistic expression of RSL will help at least someone to look around smiling, to make them more familiar and so less scared about a linguistic and cultural minority living among them. We are saying something like:</p>
                <p><i>Hi, everyone! There is a thing called sign language. And you actually can sing in it as in any other language. And it can be even more expressive than with a spoken language. We are just like you, we live here, we know same songs. And just like you we are full of New-Year-mood and can't wait for celebrations and holidays. Ready for some fun? Let's sing and dance! It never harms to learn a bit of a new language to find new friends you can sing and dance with.</i></p>
